#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) is an emerging set of standards for identifying and listing software components, information about those components, and supply chain relationships between them. This profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of Software Bill of Materials retrieval.

# Agreements in Principle
Editor's Placeholder:

This section is for agreements-in-principle
that actual text needs to added once
(1) move to new template complete and
(2) actual text put in right places and agreed to.

## split into 2 Commands
The SBOM AP must handle the following conditions:

- "one" SBOM available in one format in one serialization
- multiple SBOMs available (eg one for application, one for container application runs in)
- multiple formats available (eg CycloneDX, SPDX, SWID) 
    + {strike out SWID}
- multiple serializations available - now including JSON
    + {only json for now}
- multiple versions of application (eg SBOM for before patch and for after patch)
- multiple versions of SBOM (eg SBOM updated with new information even though application itself didn't change)
- SBOMs may be present on device (and hence returnable with another query command) or SBOMs may be elsewhere (eg a URI)
    + allow for multiple answers

There are more choices than when the AP was first conceived so
a proposal to change a different approach was discussed and approved in prinicple
The current draft contains a single query that asks
for a single sbom
qualified by prioritized list of preferred format/serializations
(and no JSON serializations were available at that time).

Proposal accepted to split into two queries:
(1) querying what SBOMs available where
    + allow for multiple answers
    + no filtering for now
(2) query to return a specific SBOM in a specific format in a specific serialization
    + only json for now

Proposal (to be discussed):
A distinction will be made between the SBOM AP and the PAC AP:
* SBOM AP will be for SBOMs resident on the device (or links to those SBOMs) FOR THE SOFTWARE ON THAT DEVICE
* PAC AP will be for SBOMs resident in the PAC (or links to those SBOMs) FOR SOFTWARE ON OTHER DEVICES

This allows simplification for SBOM AP and obviates the need for filtering on the sbom-list query.
I.e. the SBOM AP will always return all SBOMs to the sbom-list query.
This will remove Q3, Q4, and Q5 that were previously in Appendix E 
because they all contain filters more appropriate for PAC AP.
Commands in examples were simplified as well.

Examples implementing the above changes are now available in Appendix E.

# 1 Introduction

<!-- All text is normative unless otherwise labeled -->


Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named openc2-file.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html openc2-file.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o openc2-file.html --metadata title="Title of Specification Version 1.0"

OASIS staff are currently using pandoc 2.6 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.6.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.7.3.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing will be handled by OASIS staff during publication.
A TC may use other ways to generate HTML from markdown, which may generate a TOC in a different way.

# 2. OpenC2 Language Binding

_This section is normative_

** Editor's Note ** add text here to reference JADN files and refer back to (or better yet, repeat) JADN wins statement earlier in this doc

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments that are meaningful in the context of an SBOM. This section also describes the appropriate format for the status and properties of a Response frame. This section is organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands.

Extensions to the Language Specification are defined in accordance with [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10), Section 3.1.5, where:

1. The unique name of the SBOM schema is `oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-sbom`
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the SBOM schema is:  `sbom`
3. The definitions of and conformance requirements for these types are contained in this document

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components
The components of an OpenC2 Command include Actions, Targets, Actuators and associated Arguments and Specifiers. Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a Command-body that is meaningful in the context of an SBOM.

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

* Action:  A subset of the Actions defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of a SBOM.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions that are external to Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10)
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the Actions in the context of a SBOM
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
* Target:  A subset of the Targets and Target-Specifiers defined in Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of SBOM and one Target (and its associated Specifier) that is defined in this specification
* Arguments:  A subset of the Arguments defined in the Language Specification and a set of Arguments defined in this specification
* Actuator:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of SBOM

### 2.1.1 Actions
Table 2.1.1-1 presents the OpenC2 Actions defined in version 1.0 of the Language Specification which are meaningful in the context of an SBOM. The particular Action/Target pairs that are required or are optional are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

**Table 2.1.1-1. Actions Applicable to SBOM**

**_Type: Action (Enumerated)_**

| ID | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3 | **query** | Initiate a request for information. Used to communicate the supported options and determine the state or settings |

### 2.1.2 Targets
Table 2.1.2-1 summarizes the Targets defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) as they relate to SBOM functionality. Table 2.1.2-2 summarizes the Targets that are defined in this specification.

#### 2.1.2.1 Common Targets
Table 2.1.2-1 lists the Targets defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are applicable to SBOM. The particular Action/Target pairs that are required or are optional are presented in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands).

**Table 2.1.2-1. Targets Applicable to SBOM**

**_Type: Target (Choice)_**

| ID | Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 9 | **features** | Features | A set of items such as Action/Target pairs, profiles versions, options that are supported by the Actuator. The Target is used with the query Action to determine an Actuator's capabilities |
| 10 | **sbom** | Sbom | Properties of a SBOM |

The semantics/ requirements as they pertain to common targets:
* fill in if we have any

#### 2.1.2.2 SBOM Targets
The list of common Targets is extended to include the additional Targets defined in this section and referenced with the SBOM namespace.

**Table 2.1.2-2. Targets Unique to SBOM**

**_Type: Target (Choice)_**

### 2.1.3 Command Arguments
Arguments provide additional precision to a Command by including information such as how, when, or where a Command is to be executed. Table 2.1.3-1 summarizes the Command Arguments defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) as they relate to SBOM functionality. Table 2.1.3-2 summarizes the Command Arguments that are defined in this specification.

#### 2.1.3.1 Common Arguments
Table 2.1.3-1 lists the Command Arguments defined in the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) that are applicable to SBOM.

**Table 2.1.3-1. Command Arguments applicable to SBOM**

The semantics/requirements as they relate to SBOM arguments:

* fill in about the choice of formats and list order is preference order

### 2.1.4 Actuator Specifiers
An Actuator is the entity that provides the functionality and performs the Action. The Actuator executes the Action on the Target. In the context of this profile, the Actuator is the SBOM and the presence of one or more Specifiers further refine which Actuator(s) shall execute the Action.

Table 2.1.4-1 lists the Specifiers that are applicable to the SBOM Actuator. [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands) provides sample Commands with the use of Specifiers.

The Actuator Specifiers defined in this document are referenced under the SBOM namespace.

| 4 | **asset_tuple** | String | 0..10 | Unique tuple identifier for a particular SBOM consisting of a list of up to 10 strings |

## 2.2 OpenC2 Response Components
Response messages originate from the Actuator as a result of a Command.

Responses associated with required Actions MUST be implemented. Implementations that include optional Actions MUST implement the RESPONSE associated with the implemented Action. Additional details regarding the Command and associated Response are captured in [Section 2.3](#23-openc2-commands). Examples are provided in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands).

### 2.2.1 Common Results
Table 2.2.1-1 lists the Response Results properties defined in the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) that are applicable to SBOM.

**Table 2.2.1-1. Response Results Applicable to SBOM**

| 200 | OK. |
| 400 | Bad Request. Unable to process Command, parsing error. |
| 500 | Internal Error. For "response_requested" value "complete", one of the following MAY apply:<br> * Cannot access file or path<br> * Rule number currently in use<br> * Rule not updated |
| 501 | Not implemented. For "response_requested" value "complete", one of the following MAY apply:<br> * Target not supported<br> * Option not supported<br> * Command not supported |

## 2.3 OpenC2 Commands

An OpenC2 Command consists of an Action/Target pair and associated Specifiers and Arguments. This section enumerates the allowed Commands and presents the associated Responses.

Table 2.3-1 defines the Commands that are valid in the context of the SBOM profile. An Action (the top row in Table 2.3-1) paired with a Target (the first column in Table 2.3-1) defines a valid Command. The subsequent subsections provide the property tables applicable to each OpenC2 Command.

**Table 2.3-1. Command Matrix**

|   | Allow | Deny | Query | Delete | Update |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **features** |   |   | valid |   |   |
| **sbom** |   |   | valid |   |   |

Table 2.3-2 defines the Command Arguments that are allowed for a particular Command by the SBOM profile. A Command (the top row in Table 2.3-2) paired with an Argument (the first column in Table 2.3-2) defines an allowable combination. The subsection identified at the intersection of the Command/Argument provides details applicable to each Command as influenced by the Argument.

**Table 2.3-2. Command Arguments Matrix**

|   | Allow _target_ | Deny _target_ | Query features | Delete SBOM:rule_number | Update file |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **response_requested** | [2.3.1](#231-allow) | [2.3.2](#232-deny) | [2.3.3.1](#2331-query-features) | [2.3.4.1](#2341-delete-SBOMrule_number) | [2.3.5.1](#2351-update-file) |
add stuff for sbom

### 2.3.1 Query
The valid Target type, associated Specifiers, and Options are summarized in [Section 2.3.3.1](#2331-query-features). Sample Commands are presented in [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands).

#### 2.3.3.1 Query features
The 'query features' Command MUST be implemented in accordance with Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10).

#### 2.3.3.1 Query sbom
The 'query sbom' Command MUST be implemented in accordance with fill-in-here


Refer to [Annex A](#annex-a-sample-commands) for sample Commands.

# Appendix B. Safety, Security and Privacy Considerations

<!-- Optional section -->

(Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in implementations of their specification and document them for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you apply for IANA registration.

While it may not be immediately obvious how your specification might make systems vulnerable to attack, most specifications, because they involve communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)] lists âeavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middleâ as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.

In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect against these risks.

We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read _Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations_, IETF [[RFC3552](#rfc3552)], for more information.

# Appendix C. Acknowledgments

<!-- Required section -->

Note: A Work Product approved by the TC must include a list of people who participated in the development of the Work Product. This is generally done by collecting the list of names in this appendix. This list shall be initially compiled by the Chair, and any Member of the TC may add or remove their names from the list by request. Remove this note before submitting for publication.

## C.1 Special Thanks

<!-- This is an optional subsection to call out contributions from TC members. If a TC wants to thank non-TC members then they should avoid using the term "contribution" and instead thank them for their "expertise" or "assistance". -->

Substantial contributions to this document from the following individuals are gratefully acknowledged:

* David Kemp, NSA
* David Lemire, HII
* Duncan Sparrell, sFractal Consulting
* Mike Rosa, NSA


## C.2 Participants

<!-- A TC can determine who they list here, however, TC Observers must not be listed. It is common practice for TCs to list everyone that was part of the TC during the creation of the document, but this is ultimately a TC decision on who they want to list and not list. -->

The following individuals have participated in the creation of this specification and are gratefully acknowledged:

# Appendix E. Command Examples
This appendix contains example commands and example responses
to/from a device with SBOM AP functionality.

The following subsections contain:
Q1. query requesting list of sboms
    - device is "simple" device
      - ie not a device running different software stacks in different cpu's
R1a. response to Q1
    - when only one sbom
    - sbom on device
R1b.  response to Q1
    - when several sboms
    - sboms only on device
R1c.  response to Q1
    - when only one sbom
    - sbom only a URI elsewhere
R1d.  response to Q1
    - when only one sbom
    - sbom in several places
Q2.  query requesting specific sbom after response R1a
R2a.  response to Q2


### Example Q1: query requesting list of sboms:
``` json
{
  "action": "query",
  "target": "sbom_list"
}
```
### Example R1a: response to query 1 when only one sbom and sbom is on device
``` json
{
  "status": 200,
  "results": {
    "sbom_list": [{
            "id": ["twinkly_maha",
                    "58156134-5547-4e4a-968f-88a33cfafc2c"],
            "filename": "twinkly_maha.0.9.0-cyclonedx-sbom.1.0.0.json",

            "notes": "this SBOM has known unknowns"
            }
    ]
    }
}
```

### R1b.  response to Q1 when several sboms, sboms only on device
note some fields optional and weren't available in this example (and saves page space).
Ie fields might not be returned due to filter request, but they also might not be returned
because they just weren't there.

``` json
